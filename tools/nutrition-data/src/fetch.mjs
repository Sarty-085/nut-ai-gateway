/**
 * Downloads and extracts the USDA FoodData Central CSV sources that
 * build.mjs ingests.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: build.mjs used to require the user to hand-curl and
 * hand-unzip two dated USDA archives into /tmp/fdc themselves, following the
 * install guide. USDA re-cuts "Foundation Foods" roughly twice a year — the
 * release this project originally pinned (2025-04-24) has since been
 * superseded twice (2025-12-18, then 2026-04-30), each under a NEW dated
 * folder name. A user who followed a guide telling them to grab "the latest"
 * release got a folder name the build script didn't recognize, and saw:
 *
 *   BUILD FAILED
 *   FDC Foundation Foods 2025-04-24: missing food.csv at
 *   /tmp/fdc/FoodData_Central_foundation_food_csv_2025-04-24/food.csv
 *
 * ...because the file genuinely wasn't there — the user had (correctly)
 * downloaded 2025-12-18 or 2026-04-30 instead.
 *
 * This script removes the manual step entirely: `npm run data:build` calls
 * it automatically when a source is missing, so there is nothing left to
 * hand-copy a stale URL for. It is also runnable standalone as
 * `npm run data:fetch` to pre-warm the cache or retry a failed download.
